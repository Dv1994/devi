                    Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as
                    the
                    11th
                    president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied
                    physics
                    and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator,
                    mainly
                    at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation
                    (ISRO)
                    and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development
                    efforts.
                    He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic
                    missile
                    and launch vehicle technology.</p>
