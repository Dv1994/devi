        <p>
        ☛ Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle <strong>Ajit Singh </strong>were active in progressive politics, taking part in the agitation
        around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914-1915.<br><br>
        ☛ Police became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and arrested him in <em>May 1927 </em>on the pretext that he had been involved in a bombing that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926.<br><br>
        ☛ He was released on a surety of Rs. 60,000 five weeks after his arrest.<br><br>
        ☛ He wrote for, and edited, Urdu and Punjabi newspapers, published in Amritsar and also contributed to low-priced pamphlets published by the Naujawan Bharat Sabha that excoriated the British.<br><br>
        ☛ He also wrote for Kirti, the journal of the Kirti Kisan Party ("Workers and Peasants Party") and briefly for the Veer Arjun newspaper, published in Delhi.<br><br>
        ☛ He often used pseudonyms, including names such as Balwant, Ranjit and Vidhrohi.<br><br>
